# About Us + Program Description:
- We are first year comp sci uni students and gamers who knows the struggles of the artifact management in Genshin Impact. We believe that many Genshin Impact players can relate to the pain and frustration in artifact levelling and grinding, due to how bad the Artifact RNG System is. Although we cannot increase any of the game's rates, we decided to create a Genshin Impact Artifact Rater to assist players in choosing the best artifacts to keep and level up with the basic features we provide!
